## Overview
##swin-v2 and implementaion

This repository contains an implementation of the Swin Transformer (first version) network using TensorFlow. Swin Transformers are a type of Vision Transformer (ViT) that have demonstrated strong performance on various computer vision tasks, particularly for hierarchical image representation.

## Installation

To get started with the Swin Transformers, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YShokrollahi/swin-transformers.git
cd swin-transformers
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have TensorFlow installed. You can install TensorFlow using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

## Usage

You can find an example of how to use the Swin Transformer network in the `SwinTransformers.ipynb` Jupyter notebook. This notebook demonstrates how to train and evaluate the Swin Transformer on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

To run the notebook, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
jupyter notebook SwinTransformers.ipynb
```
